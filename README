exoduscli
==========

exoduscli is a wrapped version of the XBMC addon, Exodus. It harnesses the power of Exodus by wrapping it with a fake/stubbed XBMC interface (`exoduscli/fakexbmc`).

This fake interface will not work on other XBMC addons because it is tailor-made for Exodus. Exodus and its dependencies are downloaded in the first run.
